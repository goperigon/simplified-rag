      "[Document(page_content=\"React 18 was announced in March 2022 and with this many new and amazing features were added. For instance, automatic batching wasn’t available in the previous versions. But in React 18, it was added. And now, as per the React blog, React 19 is also coming.\\n\\nManual memoization is done whenever there’s too much re-rendering in case a state changes. But you see this very action is not right. Because it can make your code a bit messy. Just one wrong step and you’ll go down the rabbit hole. Even React considers manual memoization just a compromise.\\n\\n They want React to re-render itself whenever there’s a state change. So, now they are developing a React compiler. It will prevent unnecessary renders. Instagram is already using it in its production. But what’s the advantage of React compiler? Well, it renders the right parts wherever a state is changed. In fact, it will also compile code as per the rules of JavaScript and React. In other words, this means that it will detect the code that isn’t aligned with the rules of React and JavaScript.\\n\\nIn React 19, Server Actions are extended to include client-only apps. The APIs are also extended so that data handling is supported in client-only apps. But wait. What are Actions?\\n\\nWell, as per React’s official website, Action allows you to pass a function to DOM elements. Further, Actions work both synchronously and asynchronously. They can also be defined on the client side.\\n\\nApart from this, two new hooks are also added in React. They are: useFormStatus and useFormState.\\n\\nThe useFormStatus Hook provides status information of the last form submission.\\n\\nTo get status information, the Submit component must be rendered within a form. The Hook returns information like the pending property which tells you if the form is actively submitting.\\n\\nThis custom hook allows you to subscribe to each form state, and isolate the re-render at the custom hook level. It has its scope in terms of form state subscription, so it would not affect other useFormState and useForm. Using this hook can reduce the re-render impact on large and complex form applications.\\n\\ndirtyFields is an object with the user-modified fields. Make sure to provide all inputs' default values via useForm, so the library can compare against the default values.\\n\\nFurther, another feature called useOptimistic will also be added in React 19. This hook will show a different state even when an async action is in progress.\\n\\nFurther, another feature called useOptimistic will also be added in React 19. This hook will show a different state even when an async action is in progress.\\n\\nFinally! React thought of something really amazing: React Canary.\\n\\nUsing this, you can test new features even when they are in the design stage. So, this means you can use new features without even waiting for React’s next version release.\\n\\nResult of all this? The community will be involved in deciding and finalizing features. So, if you want to include yourself in finalizing features of React, make sure you check the React Labs Blog Series. For now, React has added React Server Component, Asset Loading, Document Metadata, and Actions in React Canary.\\n\\nApart from these, in React 19, you will also find:\\n• None Directives namely use client and use server. Using these directives, you’ll be able to write reusable components.\\n• None Built-in support when it comes to rendering title, meta, and link tags. Further, their work will be similar in every environment.\\n• None Resource Loading APIs as well as Suspense integrated with resources like stylesheets, fonts, and scripts.\\n\\nIn short, in React 19, directives, built-in support for varying tags, two hooks, automatic rendering, and react canaries are all new!\"), Document(page_content='Hello everyone. I would like to write about useFormStatus updated in React 19, which is one of new hooks. This hook is relevant to Form Actions. Hence, If you do not understand Form Actions, please read the previous post before reading this article.\\n\\n\"useFormStatus\" is new hook obtain the status during form submission. Using this hook, you can display the status of the form on the screen, or restrict form input during submission.\\n\\nThe feature of this form is following description.\\n• None When you click the registration button on the form, the entered name will be output to the debug console log as server-side processing.\\n• None Because I want to check the status of the form, I intentionally delay the process by using PROMISE and SET TIMEOUT.\\n\\nThe element(submission button) under the form that use server action, which is converted into child component. In this case, I converted button element into Register.tsx.\\n\\nI added following in the Register.tsx.\\n• None \"const { pending } = useFormStatus();\" is to get the status of form submission. The text of the button is changed by changing the content of the variable “pending”.\\n\\n④Result\\n\\n \\n\\n I can see the Loading during submission of the form.\\n\\nThanks for reading this article.\\n\\n Next time, I will explain a new hook, which is useFormState.'), Document(page_content=\"The last time React released a version was on June 14, 2022, with the version number being 18.2.0.\\n\\n Now, let's take an early look at the new features that might be officially released in version 19, based on the latest news from the React team.\\n\\nReact can re-render more than necessary when state changes. Currently, this solution for these situation is used by manual memoization by using , . However, react compiler solve this issue. It will manage these re-renders and decide automatically how and when to change the state and update the UI. That's why such manual memoization will no longer be necessary in React 19.\\n\\nTraditionally, Server Actions which are solutions for sending data from the client to the server were only available for server-side rendering in Next.js. \\n\\n However, with Actions in React 19, a portion of that functionality is being extended to also work on the client-side. This means that Actions are become used in client-side code for single-page applications (SPA).\\n\\nAs per React’s official website, Action allows us to pass a function to DOM elements. Further, Actions work both synchronously and asynchronously. We can access the current status and response of form operations through the useFormStatus and useFormState hooks. In short, we'll be able to replace the event with actions.\\n\\n In addition to combining with and , actions can also be used with for managing optimistic state updates.\\n\\nAs I told you earlier, React 19 introduces new form-related hooks , and and . These new hooks provide functionalities related to managing form status, form state, optimistic state updates, and transitions in React applications.\\n\\nhelps us have more control over the forms you create. It is useful when we want to know status information about the form submission（pending or not） and accordingly display the data.\\n\\nallows us to update state based on the result of the form submission.\\n\\nallows us to optimistically update the UI during asynchronous operations. It accepts the current state and an update function as parameters, return a copy of the state that may differ during the asynchronous operation.\\n\\nlets us update the state without blocking the UI. The hook is already available in React 18.2. What's new in React 19 is that you can now pass an async function to startTransition, which is awaited by React to start the transition.\\n\\nUntil now, React components have primarily run on the client side. However, in React 19, server components which is already implemented in Next.js will be integrated directly into React. All the components in React by default are client side. Only when you use on the top of file becomes the component be a server component which runs on the server.\\n\\nNew React 19 features make us to build websites and web applications a lot easier and better. When is React 19 available? I'm not sure. But as of now, we can use it for our own learning, or having fun only. Avoid using them for customer facing apps at the moment. After React 19 released officially, it's better to use their features for creating websites and web application better and faster for sure.\"), Document(page_content='As the release of is coming soon, it is promising some awesome features. This release is not just another update, it’s poised to redefine how we approach code. Promising to deliver enhanced speed, efficiency, and a more streamlined coding experience, is set to elevate web development to new heights. Let’s dive into what is preparing for us in the upcoming release.\\n\\nThe introduction of the in version marks a significant transformation in development, setting a new benchmark in performance optimization. Codenamed “ ”, this innovative compiler is engineered to transmute React code into standard JavaScript, potentially doubling its efficiency.\\n\\nThe core challenge that “ ” addresses is a known limitation in — the unnecessary re-rendering of entire components even when only minor parts change. Historically, developers have leveraged the hook to cache results between renders, a process that required manual intervention and often led to more complex code structures. The React Compiler elegantly automates this optimization, promising not only heightened performance but also a move towards cleaner and more streamlined code.\\n\\nA notable milestone for the is its deployment in a production environment at Instagram, demonstrating its efficacy and stability. However, it’s important to note that, as of now, this compiler remains proprietary, not yet released as open-source. This limits broader community access and integration, but it’s a significant step forward in showcasing the practical applications and benefits of this technology in a real-world, large-scale environment.\\n\\nintroduces , making it easier to work with data in your app. Think of as a smarter way to connect functions to things like forms in your app. They handle data neatly, whether the actions are immediate or take a bit of time. This makes writing code for forms and data updates simpler and more organized.'), Document(page_content='The last time React put out a new version was on June 14, 2022, and it was called 18.2.0. In the world of building websites and apps, React is super popular. But it\\'s been a while since they gave us something new to work with. This made some important people in the React community unhappy.\\n\\nNow, after a lot of people got upset, React has finally announced a new version.\\n\\nReact\\'s team explained why it took so long to release something new. They said the features they\\'ve been working on needed a lot of time to make sure they all fit together well. They\\'ve been adding these features gradually to what they call the Canary version, which is like a test version.\\n\\nEven though they haven\\'t officially released a new version in almost two years, they\\'ve been updating the Canary version with some pretty cool stuff, like new hooks and directives. These updates have made React even better, especially for making full-stack frameworks like Next.js and Remix.\\n\\nReact\\'s team confirmed that the next big release will be called version 19.0.0. So, exciting things are on the way!\\n\\nA major leap in React\\'s capabilities, React Compiler is now powering Instagram.com in production and is no longer just a research project. By implementing an optimized compiler, it solves the problem of excessive re-renders on state changes.\\n\\nThis compiler eliminates code bloat by automatically re-rendering certain UI elements when the state changes, in contrast to human memoization. It guarantees performance and safety by adhering to JavaScript and React guidelines.\\n\\nTools such as Strict Mode and React\\'s ESLint plugin allow developers to validate their code. With plans for an open-source release, the compiler - which is now operational on Instagram.com - is primed for additional integration across Metasurfaces.\\n\\nAction is game changer in this version. You can pass a function to DOM elements using actions, such\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is possible for the action function to function asynchronously or synchronously. It can be defined using the directive on the server or on the client side using regular JavaScript. When an action is used, React handles the data submission life cycle and provides hooks like and to retrieve the state and response of the active form action. Actions are submitted by default inside of a transition, preserving the current page\\'s interactivity while processing. in transitions allows for the use of async functions and allows the display of pending user interface (UI). The state is used to indicate that processing is still happening during asynchronous requests, such as data fetching.\\n\\nAfter being included in the Canary version for some time, the use client and use server directives will be part of the Stable version as of v19.\\n\\nWhen Next.js used these two directives in production, the React team was often criticized in the community for enabling Next.js to use unstable features ahead of schedule and for allegedly harming the React ecosystem.\\n\\nIf you\\'re utilizing React instead of a full-stack framework, you just need to comprehend these two directives\\' purposes: The \"split points\" between the server-side and front-end contexts are indicated by the use of client and commands.\\n\\nThe packaging tool is instructed to construct a tag by use the client and to create a POST endpoint by using server. Developers can write server-side and client-side code in the same file thanks to these directives.\\n\\nIn v19, the new hook useOptimistic is probably going to be tagged as stable. During asynchronous actions (like network requests), enables you to refresh the user interface in an optimistic manner.\\n\\nIt returns a replica of the state that might change during the asynchronous operation, accepting as inputs the current state and an update function. It is necessary to supply a function that receives the input of the operation and the current state, returns the optimistic state to be utilised in the interim until the operation is completed.\\n\\n\\n\\nComponents such as \"title,\" \"meta tags,\" and \"description\" are essential for both accessibility and SEO optimization. It might be a pain to manage these items across several routes in React since single-page applications are common.\\n\\nAt the moment, developers frequently use packages like react-helmet or write custom code to manage route changes and update metadata appropriately. This is a tedious and prone-to-error process, particularly when working with SEO-sensitive aspects such as meta tags.\\n\\nYou must carefully control how quickly and smoothly your applications load in React, especially when using images and other asset files.\\n\\nStylesheets, fonts, and graphics are usually rendered in the browser after the view. This may cause a flicker between a stylized view and non-styled content or a flash of unstyled content.\\n\\nDevelopers frequently use custom code to determine when these assets are ready in order to mitigate this issue and make sure the view is displayed only after everything has loaded.\\n\\nWhen a user navigates the current page with React 19, photos and other files will load in the background. This enhancement ought to facilitate faster page loads and shorter wait times.\\n\\nAdditionally, React is offering lifecycle Suspense for loading assets, including fonts, stylesheets, and scripts. With this feature, \"unstyled\" flickering is eliminated, as React is able to detect when the information is ready to be displayed.\\n\\nTo give users more control over when a resource loads and initializes, new Resource Loading APIs like preload and preinit have been introduced.\\n\\nReact 19 minimizes waiting times and makes sure users can engage with the content uninterrupted by letting assets load asynchronously in the background.\\n\\nTo transition your current application to React 19, adhere to the following guidelines:\\n• None Evaluate Your Application: Comprehend how the modifications will affect your existing\\n• None Implement Changes Gradually: Introduce adjustments incrementally to prevent disruptions to your application\\'s functionality.\\n• None Utilize Codemods: Employ tools like codemods to automate the updating.\\n• None Enable Strict Mode: Activate Strict Mode to identify potential issues at an early.\\n\\nAs of now, there is no official React 19 release date announced. However, the React team has indicated that it will be released sometime this year.\\n\\nKey Points regarding React 19 and its Features:\\n• None React 19 is currently under development, with an expected official release in June or July\\n• None React 19 will introduce support for new web platform APIs, including the replace text\\n• None Emphasis is placed on \"progressive enhancement,\" focusing on features that enhance performance and developer experience without being\\n• None The upgrade process should be relatively seamless for most React applications, although some potentially disruptive changes are planned to streamline the codebase.\\n\\nWith revolutionary features like the React Compiler and Actions, React 19 dramatically improves data handling and UI optimization. These improvements simplify the development process, increasing the effectiveness and developer friendliness of React apps.\\n\\nReact is still developing, but it provides a more user-friendly and robust framework for creating dynamic online apps by automating optimizations and streamlining form management.'), Document(page_content='React 19 introduces a variety of new features, and one of the most talked-about additions is the hook. This hook represents a significant step forward in React’s API, offering more flexibility and power to developers. Let’s dive into what the use() hook is and how you can leverage it in your React applications.\\n\\nUnderstanding the use() Hook\\n\\n The use() hook is a part of React’s experimental API, currently available in the Canary and experimental channels1. It allows you to read the value of a resource, such as a Promise or context, within your components or custom hooks1. Unlike traditional hooks, use() can be called within loops and conditional statements, providing greater flexibility in your code structure2.\\n\\nKey Features of use()\\n\\n Reading Context: It works similarly to useContext, but with the added benefit of being callable inside conditionals and loops1.\\n\\n Integration with Suspense: When called with a Promise, it integrates with Suspense and error boundaries, allowing for smoother asynchronous operations1.\\n\\n Flexibility: It can be used within various control flow statements without the restrictions of other hooks2.\\n\\nExample Usage\\n\\n Let’s look at a simple example of how you might use the use() hook to fetch data from an API and display it in a component:\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this snippet, FetchComponent uses the use() hook to read the value of dataResource. If dataResource is a Promise, the component will suspend rendering until the Promise resolves, displaying the fallback in the meantime.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n The hook is a powerful addition to React’s arsenal, providing developers with more control over how and when they access resources in their components. As React 19 continues to evolve, we can expect to see more innovative ways to use this hook to build efficient and flexible applications.\\n\\nStay tuned for more updates on React 19 and its exciting new features!'), Document(page_content=\"Hey there, React devs!

With just a few lines of code, you're leveraging the power of Actions to handle all the nitty-gritty details of state management. The hook takes care of pending states, while your function gracefully manages asynchronous transitions like a pro.\\n\\nWhy Actions Are Your New Bestie\\n\\nLet me tell you – as a fellow React developer, Actions have been a total game-changer for me. Gone are the days of wrangling with complex state management logic. Now, I can focus on crafting delightful user experiences without getting bogged down in boilerplate code.\\n\\nBut the best part? Actions aren't just efficient – they're also incredibly friendly to work with. Their simplicity and readability make coding a breeze, while their built-in support for best practices like optimistic updates ensures your apps stay rock-solid and reliable.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, Actions in React 19 are like having a trusty sidekick by your side, helping you conquer state management challenges with ease. So go ahead, give them a spin – I guarantee you'll wonder how you ever lived without them!\\n\\nWith Actions in React 19, state management just got a whole lot friendlier. Say goodbye to complexity and hello to simplicity – your React code will thank you for it!\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts on Actions in React 19? Are you excited to give them a try in your projects?

This was added “to make the common cases easier for Actions,” the team wrote.\\n• React DOM  Actions. Actions are integrated with React 19’s new  features for react-dom.\\n• React DOM: New hook: useFormStatus, which makes it easier to write design components that need access to information about the  they’re in, without drilling props down to the component.\\n• New hook: useOptimistic. “Another common UI pattern when performing a data mutation is to show the final state optimistically while the async request is underway,” the team wrote. “In React 19, we’re adding a new hook called useOptimistic to make this easier.”\\n• New API: use. There’s a new API to read resources in render: use. This can be used to read a promise, which React will suspend until the promise resolves.\\n\\nThe team also explained a bit more about React Server Components. They are a new option the “allows rendering components ahead of time, before bundling, in an environment separate from your client or SSR server,” the team wrote. The separate environment is the “server” and server components can run once at build time on a CI server or they can be run for each request using a web server, the team explained.\\n\\n“This means libraries that ship with Server Components can now target React 19 as a peer dependency with a react-server export condition for use in frameworks that support the Full-stack React Architecture,” the team noted.\\n\\nWhile React Server Components are stable and won’t break between major visions, alas the underlying API used to implement the components bundler or framework “do not follow server and may break between minors in React 19.x,” the team wrote.\\n\\n“To support React Server Components as a bundler or framework, we recommend pinning to a specific React version, or using the Canary release,” the blog post about the release stated. “We will continue working with bundlers and frameworks to stabilize the APIs used to implement React Server Components in the future.”\\n\\nWhile we’re on the topic, Redwood.js, a JavaScript framework, is tinkering with React Server Components by building out documentation. Redwood.js added support for the components in late March. The team wanted to see how it’d be to build out a documentation site with React Server Component. The resulting document app is called Docwood. They set the following requirements for the project:\\n• The docs site must be a real React app running in the browser and not a statically generated site.\\n• Viewing a doc meant invoking the RSC flow to make a request to a server, where the Markdown would be complied and returned on the fly.\\n• No pre-converted Markdown->HTML stored anywhere, no content stored in a database, no pre-processing of docs files at build time. “However, Redwood’s service caching could be used, since we would still be performing a full RSC request and converting Markdown to HTML on the fly to populate the cache,” they added. The team explains how to create a new Redwood app from scratch and how to handle routing and navigation. They found that the application was relatively fast considering how much computation is happening under the hood. “RSC is still being actively developed and new features added every day, so we expect the experience to improve quite a bit between now and the real release of RedwoodJS Bighorn,” the team wrote. The beta of TypeScript 5.5 became available Thursday. The first in a long list of new features is inferred type predicates, implemented by developer Dan Vanderkam, who explained that TypeScript can now infer a type predicate for the filter function. He writes that TypeScript will infer a function returns a type predicate if:\\n• The function does not have an explicit return type or type predicate annotation.\\n• The function has a single return statement and no implicit returns.\\n• The function does not mutate its parameter.\\n• The function returns a boolean expression that’s tied to a refinement on the parameter. Vanderkam wrote in depth about his experience volunteering with TypeScript, with an explanation of how he came to find ideas about how to contribute. Among the new features added in this beta: This beta also includes a number of improvements to performance and size, wrote Daniel Rosenwasser, the senior program manager of TypeScript. “In TypeScript 5.0, we ensured that our Node and Symbol objects had a consistent set of properties with a consistent initialization order,” Rosenwasser explained. “Doing so helps reduce polymorphism in different operations, which allows runtimes to fetch properties more quickly.” That led to “impressive speed wins in the compiler,” he added. “In TypeScript 5.5, the same monomorphization work has been done for the language service and public API,” he continued. “What this means is that your editor experience, and any build tools that use the TypeScript API, will get a decent amount faster.” In benchmarks, that’s led to a 5 to 8% speedup in build times when using the public TypeScript API’s allocators, and language service operations became 10 to 20% faster, he wrote. “While this does imply an increase in memory, we believe that tradeoff is worth it and hope to find ways to reduce that memory overhead.” Rosenwasser said. “Things should feel a lot snappier now.” The package size was also significantly reduced by making and import from a common API library, rather than each producing a standalone bundles. That led to size on disk decreasing from 30.2 MB to 20.4 MB, and reduced the package size from 5.5 MB to 3.7 MB, he noted. The team has also published an iteration schedule with target release dates.')]\n",
      "[Document(page_content='React 18 was announced in March 2022 and with this many new and amazing features were added. For instance, automatic batching wasn’t available in the previous versions. But in React 18, it was added. And now, as per the React blog, React 19 is also coming.\\n\\nManual memoization is done whenever there’s too much re-rendering in case a state changes. But you see this very action is not right. Because it can make your code a bit messy. Just one wrong step and you’ll go down the rabbit hole. Even React considers manual memoization just a compromise.\\n\\n They want React to re-render itself whenever there’s a state change. So, now they are developing a React compiler. It will prevent unnecessary renders. Instagram is already using it in its production. But what’s the advantage of React compiler? Well, it renders the right parts wherever a state is changed. In fact, it will also compile code as per the rules of JavaScript and React. In other words, this means that it will detect the code that'), Document(page_content='isn’t aligned with the rules of React and JavaScript.\\n\\nIn React 19, Server Actions are extended to include client-only apps. The APIs are also extended so that data handling is supported in client-only apps. But wait. What are Actions?\\n\\nWell, as per React’s official website, Action allows you to pass a function to DOM elements. Further, Actions work both synchronously and asynchronously. They can also be defined on the client side.\\n\\nApart from this, two new hooks are also added in React. They are: useFormStatus and useFormState.\\n\\nThe useFormStatus Hook provides status information of the last form submission.\\n\\nTo get status information, the Submit component must be rendered within a form. The Hook returns information like the pending property which tells you if the form is actively submitting.\\n\\nThis custom hook allows you to subscribe to each form state, and isolate the re-render at the custom hook level. It has its scope in terms of form state subscription, so it would not affect'), Document(page_content=\"other useFormState and useForm. Using this hook can reduce the re-render impact on large and complex form applications.\\n\\ndirtyFields is an object with the user-modified fields. Make sure to provide all inputs' default values via useForm, so the library can compare against the default values.\\n\\nFurther, another feature called useOptimistic will also be added in React 19.

This hook will show a different state even when an async action is in progress.\\n\\nFinally! React thought of something really amazing: React Canary.\\n\\nUsing this, you can test new features even when they are in the design stage. So, this means you can use new features without even waiting for React’s next version release.\\n\\nResult of all this? The community will be involved in deciding and finalizing features. So, if you want to include yourself in finalizing features\"), Document(page_content='of React, make sure you check the React Labs Blog Series. For now, React has added React Server Component, Asset Loading, Document Metadata, and Actions in React Canary.\\n\\nApart from these, in React 19, you will also find:\\n• None Directives namely use client and use server. Using these directives, you’ll be able to write reusable components.\\n• None Built-in support when it comes to rendering title, meta, and link tags. Further, their work will be similar in every environment.\\n• None Resource Loading APIs as well as Suspense integrated with resources like stylesheets, fonts, and scripts.\\n\\nIn short, in React 19, directives, built-in support for varying tags, two hooks, automatic rendering, and react canaries are all new!'), Document(page_content='Hello everyone.

Using this hook, you can display the status of the form on the screen, or restrict form input during submission.\\n\\nThe feature of this form is following description.\\n• None When you click the registration button on the form, the entered name will be output to the debug console log as server-side processing.\\n• None Because I want to check the status of the form, I intentionally delay the process by using PROMISE and SET TIMEOUT.\\n\\nThe element(submission button) under the form that use server action, which is converted into child component.

Currently, this solution for these situation is used by manual memoization by using , . However, react compiler solve this issue. It will manage these re-renders and decide automatically how and when to change the state and update the UI. That's why such manual memoization will no longer be necessary in React 19.\\n\\nTraditionally, Server Actions which are solutions for sending data from the client to the server were only available for server-side rendering in Next.js. \\n\\n However, with Actions in React 19, a portion of that functionality is being extended to also work on the client-side. This means that Actions are become used in client-side code for single-page applications (SPA).\\n\\nAs\"), Document(page_content=\"per React’s official website, Action allows us to pass a function to DOM elements. Further, Actions work both synchronously and asynchronously. We can access the current status and response of form operations through the useFormStatus and useFormState hooks. In short, we'll be able to replace the event with actions.\\n\\n In addition to combining with and , actions can also be used with for managing optimistic state updates.\\n\\nAs I told you earlier, React 19 introduces new form-related hooks , and and . These new hooks provide functionalities related to managing form status, form state, optimistic state updates, and transitions in React applications.\\n\\nhelps us have more control over the forms you create. It is useful when we want to know status information about the form submission（pending or not） and accordingly display the data.\\n\\nallows us to update state based on the result of the form submission.\\n\\nallows us to optimistically update the UI during asynchronous operations. It accepts the\"), Document(page_content=\"current state and an update function as parameters, return a copy of the state that may differ during the asynchronous operation.\\n\\nlets us update the state without blocking the UI. The hook is already available in React 18.2. What's new in React 19 is that you can now pass an async function to startTransition, which is awaited by React to start the transition.\\n\\nUntil now, React components have primarily run on the client side. However, in React 19, server components which is already implemented in Next.js will be integrated directly into React. All the components in React by default are client side. Only when you use on the top of file becomes the component be a server component which runs on the server.\\n\\nNew React 19 features make us to build websites and web applications a lot easier and better.

Let’s dive into what is preparing for us in the upcoming release.\\n\\nThe introduction of the in version marks a significant transformation in development, setting a new benchmark in performance optimization. Codenamed “ ”, this innovative compiler is engineered to transmute React code into standard JavaScript, potentially doubling its efficiency.\\n\\nThe core challenge that “ ” addresses is a known limitation in — the unnecessary re-rendering of entire components even when only minor parts change.

This made some important people in the React community unhappy.\\n\\nNow, after a lot of people got upset, React has finally announced a new version.\\n\\nReact's team explained why it took so long to release something new. They said the features they've been working on needed a lot of time to make sure they all fit together well. They've been adding these features gradually to what they call the Canary version, which is like a test version.\\n\\nEven though they haven't officially released a new version in almost two years, they've been updating the Canary version with some pretty cool stuff, like new hooks and directives.

Actions are submitted by default inside of a transition, preserving the current page's interactivity while processing. in transitions allows for the use of async functions and allows the display of pending user interface (UI). The state is used to indicate that processing is still happening during asynchronous requests, such as data fetching.\\n\\nAfter being included in the Canary version for some time, the use client and use server directives will be part of the Stable version as of v19.\\n\\nWhen Next.js used these two directives in production, the React team was often criticized in the community for enabling Next.js to use unstable features ahead of schedule and for allegedly harming the React ecosystem.\\n\\nIf you're utilizing React instead of a\"), Document(page_content='full-stack framework, you just need to comprehend these two directives\\' purposes: The \"split points\" between the server-side and front-end contexts are indicated by the use of client and commands.\\n\\nThe packaging tool is instructed to construct a tag by use the client and to create a POST endpoint by using server.

During asynchronous actions (like network requests), enables you to refresh the user interface in an optimistic manner.\\n\\nIt returns a replica of the state that might change during the asynchronous operation, accepting as inputs the current state and an update function. It is necessary to supply a function that receives the input of the operation and the current state, returns the optimistic state to be utilised in the interim until the operation is completed.\\n\\n\\n\\nComponents such as \"title,\" \"meta tags,\"'), Document(page_content='and \"description\" are essential for both accessibility and SEO optimization. It might be a pain to manage these items across several routes in React since single-page applications are common.\\n\\nAt the moment, developers frequently use packages like react-helmet or write custom code to manage route changes and update metadata appropriately. This is a tedious and prone-to-error process, particularly when working with SEO-sensitive aspects such as meta tags.\\n\\nYou must carefully control how quickly and smoothly your applications load in React, especially when using images and other asset files.\\n\\nStylesheets, fonts, and graphics are usually rendered in the browser after the view. This may cause a flicker between a stylized view and non-styled content or a flash of unstyled content.\\n\\nDevelopers frequently use custom code to determine when these assets are ready in order to mitigate this issue and make sure the view is displayed only after everything has loaded.\\n\\nWhen a user navigates the'), Document(page_content='current page with React 19, photos and other files will load in the background.

This hook represents a significant step forward in React’s API, offering more flexibility and power to developers. Let’s dive into what the use() hook is and how you can leverage it in your React applications.\\n\\nUnderstanding the use() Hook\\n\\n The use() hook is a part of React’s experimental API, currently available in the Canary and experimental channels1. It allows you to read the value of a resource, such as a Promise or context, within your components or custom hooks1. Unlike traditional hooks, use() can be called within loops and conditional statements, providing greater flexibility in your code structure2.\\n\\nKey Features of use()\\n\\n Reading Context: It works similarly to useContext, but with the added benefit of being callable inside conditionals and loops1.\\n\\n Integration with Suspense: When called with a Promise, it integrates with Suspense and error boundaries, allowing for'), Document(page_content='smoother asynchronous operations1.\\n\\n Flexibility: It can be used within various control flow statements without the restrictions of other hooks2.\\n\\nExample Usage\\n\\n Let’s look at a simple example of how you might use the use() hook to fetch data from an API and display it in a component:\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this snippet, FetchComponent uses the use() hook to read the value of dataResource. If dataResource is a Promise, the component will suspend rendering until the Promise resolves, displaying the fallback in the meantime.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n The hook is a powerful addition to React’s arsenal, providing developers with more control over how and when they access resources in their components. As React 19 continues to evolve, we can expect to see more innovative ways to use this hook to build efficient and flexible applications.\\n\\nStay tuned for more updates on React 19 and its exciting new features!'), Document(page_content=\"Hey there, React devs!

This was added “to make the common cases easier for Actions,” the team wrote.\\n• React DOM  Actions. Actions are integrated with React 19’s new  features for react-dom.\\n• React DOM: New hook: useFormStatus, which makes it easier to write design components that need access to information about the  they’re in, without drilling props down to the component.\\n• New hook: useOptimistic. “Another common UI pattern when performing a data mutation is to show the final state optimistically while the async request is underway,” the team wrote. “In React 19, we’re adding a new hook called useOptimistic'), Document(page_content='to make this easier.”\\n• New API: use. There’s a new API to read resources in render: use. This can be used to read a promise, which React will suspend until the promise resolves.\\n\\nThe team also explained a bit more about React Server Components. They are a new option the “allows rendering components ahead of time, before bundling, in an environment separate from your client or SSR server,” the team wrote. The separate environment is the “server” and server components can run once at build time on a CI server or they can be run for each request using a web server, the team explained.\\n\\n“This means libraries that ship with Server Components can now target React 19 as a peer dependency with a react-server export condition for use in frameworks that support the Full-stack React Architecture,” the team noted.\\n\\nWhile React Server Components are stable and won’t break between major visions, alas the underlying API used to implement the components bundler or framework “do not follow server and'), Document(page_content='may break between minors in React 19.x,” the team wrote.\\n\\n“To support React Server Components as a bundler or framework, we recommend pinning to a specific React version, or using the Canary release,” the blog post about the release stated. “We will continue working with bundlers and frameworks to stabilize the APIs used to implement React Server Components in the future.”\\n\\nWhile we’re on the topic, Redwood.js, a JavaScript framework, is tinkering with React Server Components by building out documentation. Redwood.js added support for the components in late March. The team wanted to see how it’d be to build out a documentation site with React Server Component. The resulting document app is called Docwood. They set the following requirements for the project:\\n• The docs site must be a real React app running in the browser and not a statically generated site.\\n• Viewing a doc meant invoking the RSC flow to make a request to a server, where the Markdown would be complied and returned on'), Document(page_content='the fly.\\n• No pre-converted Markdown->HTML stored anywhere, no content stored in a database, no pre-processing of docs files at build time. “However, Redwood’s service caching could be used, since we would still be performing a full RSC request and converting Markdown to HTML on the fly to populate the cache,” they added. The team explains how to create a new Redwood app from scratch and how to handle routing and navigation. They found that the application was relatively fast considering how much computation is happening under the hood. “RSC is still being actively developed and new features added every day, so we expect the experience to improve quite a bit between now and the real release of RedwoodJS Bighorn,” the team wrote. The beta of TypeScript 5.5 became available Thursday. The first in a long list of new features is inferred type predicates, implemented by developer Dan Vanderkam, who explained that TypeScript can now infer a type predicate for the filter function. He writes'), Document(page_content='that TypeScript will infer a function returns a type predicate if:\\n• The function does not have an explicit return type or type predicate annotation.\\n• The function has a single return statement and no implicit returns.\\n• The function does not mutate its parameter.\\n• The function returns a boolean expression that’s tied to a refinement on the parameter. Vanderkam wrote in depth about his experience volunteering with TypeScript, with an explanation of how he came to find ideas about how to contribute. Among the new features added in this beta: This beta also includes a number of improvements to performance and size, wrote Daniel Rosenwasser, the senior program manager of TypeScript. “In TypeScript 5.0, we ensured that our Node and Symbol objects had a consistent set of properties with a consistent initialization order,” Rosenwasser explained. “Doing so helps reduce polymorphism in different operations, which allows runtimes to fetch properties more quickly.” That led to “impressive'), Document(page_content='speed wins in the compiler,” he added. “In TypeScript 5.5, the same monomorphization work has been done for the language service and public API,” he continued. “What this means is that your editor experience, and any build tools that use the TypeScript API, will get a decent amount faster.” In benchmarks, that’s led to a 5 to 8% speedup in build times when using the public TypeScript API’s allocators, and language service operations became 10 to 20% faster, he wrote. “While this does imply an increase in memory, we believe that tradeoff is worth it and hope to find ways to reduce that memory overhead.” Rosenwasser said. “Things should feel a lot snappier now.” The package size was also significantly reduced by making and import from a common API library, rather than each producing a standalone bundles. That led to size on disk decreasing from 30.2 MB to 20.4 MB, and reduced the package size from 5.5 MB to 3.7 MB, he noted.

       " Document(page_content='React 19 beta released Thursday and it includes all of the React Server Components features from the canary channel.\\n\\nNew features in this beta include:\\n• Actions. “In React 19, we’re adding support for using async functions in transitions to handle pending states, errors, forms, and optimistic updates automatically,” the team stated in a blog post about the React 19 beta.\\n• New hook: useActionState. This was added “to make the common cases easier for Actions,” the team wrote.\\n• React DOM  Actions. Actions are integrated with React 19’s new  features for react-dom.\\n• React DOM: New hook: useFormStatus, which makes it easier to write design components that need access to information about the  they’re in, without drilling props down to the component.\\n• New hook: useOptimistic. “Another common UI pattern when performing a data mutation is to show the final state optimistically while the async request is underway,” the team wrote. “In React 19, we’re adding a new hook called useOptimistic'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='to make this easier.”\\n• New API: use. There’s a new API to read resources in render: use. This can be used to read a promise, which React will suspend until the promise resolves.\\n\\nThe team also explained a bit more about React Server Components. They are a new option the “allows rendering components ahead of time, before bundling, in an environment separate from your client or SSR server,” the team wrote. The separate environment is the “server” and server components can run once at build time on a CI server or they can be run for each request using a web server, the team explained.\\n\\n“This means libraries that ship with Server Components can now target React 19 as a peer dependency with a react-server export condition for use in frameworks that support the Full-stack React Architecture,” the team noted.\\n\\nWhile React Server Components are stable and won’t break between major visions, alas the underlying API used to implement the components bundler or framework “do not follow server and'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='may break between minors in React 19.x,” the team wrote.\\n\\n“To support React Server Components as a bundler or framework, we recommend pinning to a specific React version, or using the Canary release,” the blog post about the release stated. “We will continue working with bundlers and frameworks to stabilize the APIs used to implement React Server Components in the future.”\\n\\nWhile we’re on the topic, Redwood.js, a JavaScript framework, is tinkering with React Server Components by building out documentation. Redwood.js added support for the components in late March. The team wanted to see how it’d be to build out a documentation site with React Server Component. The resulting document app is called Docwood. They set the following requirements for the project:\\n• The docs site must be a real React app running in the browser and not a statically generated site.\\n• Viewing a doc meant invoking the RSC flow to make a request to a server, where the Markdown would be complied and returned on'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='the fly.\\n• No pre-converted Markdown->HTML stored anywhere, no content stored in a database, no pre-processing of docs files at build time. “However, Redwood’s service caching could be used, since we would still be performing a full RSC request and converting Markdown to HTML on the fly to populate the cache,” they added. The team explains how to create a new Redwood app from scratch and how to handle routing and navigation. They found that the application was relatively fast considering how much computation is happening under the hood. “RSC is still being actively developed and new features added every day, so we expect the experience to improve quite a bit between now and the real release of RedwoodJS Bighorn,” the team wrote. The beta of TypeScript 5.5 became available Thursday. The first in a long list of new features is inferred type predicates, implemented by developer Dan Vanderkam, who explained that TypeScript can now infer a type predicate for the filter function. He writes'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='that TypeScript will infer a function returns a type predicate if:\\n• The function does not have an explicit return type or type predicate annotation.\\n• The function has a single return statement and no implicit returns.\\n• The function does not mutate its parameter.\\n• The function returns a boolean expression that’s tied to a refinement on the parameter. Vanderkam wrote in depth about his experience volunteering with TypeScript, with an explanation of how he came to find ideas about how to contribute. Among the new features added in this beta: This beta also includes a number of improvements to performance and size, wrote Daniel Rosenwasser, the senior program manager of TypeScript. “In TypeScript 5.0, we ensured that our Node and Symbol objects had a consistent set of properties with a consistent initialization order,” Rosenwasser explained. “Doing so helps reduce polymorphism in different operations, which allows runtimes to fetch properties more quickly.” That led to “impressive'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='speed wins in the compiler,” he added. “In TypeScript 5.5, the same monomorphization work has been done for the language service and public API,” he continued. “What this means is that your editor experience, and any build tools that use the TypeScript API, will get a decent amount faster.” In benchmarks, that’s led to a 5 to 8% speedup in build times when using the public TypeScript API’s allocators, and language service operations became 10 to 20% faster, he wrote. “While this does imply an increase in memory, we believe that tradeoff is worth it and hope to find ways to reduce that memory overhead.” Rosenwasser said. “Things should feel a lot snappier now.” The package size was also significantly reduced by making and import from a common API library, rather than each producing a standalone bundles. That led to size on disk decreasing from 30.2 MB to 20.4 MB, and reduced the package size from 5.5 MB to 3.7 MB, he noted. The team has also published an iteration schedule with target'),\n",
